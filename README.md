# Foodborne Disease Illness Trends between 1998-2015 (Project 1 - Coming Soon)
Foodborne disease outbreaks occur when two or more people ingest the same contaminated food or drink. This project analyzes trends over a 20+ year period to answer a few questions, like what year had the highest amount of outbreaks as well as what organism was responsible for the highest amount of outbreaks. 


# Predicting Chronic Kidney Disease with Logistic Regression (Project 2 - Coming Soon)
The use of laboratory results can be helpful when analyzing the risk of developing chronic diseases. This logistic regression model analyzes the results of Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and Urinalysis to determine the probability of developing chronic kidney disease.
